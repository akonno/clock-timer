        <p class="block">
            I recognized the necessity for an application that simultaneously displays a clock and a timer, which is particularly useful during tasks involving lengthy durations where monitoring the current time is essential.
        </p>
        <p class="block">
            Additionally, I find it unsettling when the second hand of the clock and the seconds of the timer are not synchronized, so I prefer that they move in harmony.
        </p>
        <p class="block">
            To prevent accidental stops or resets, you may want to disable the timer buttons while the timer is running.
        </p>
        <p class="block">
            Faced with the absence of such a solution, I was motivated to create this app myself.

        <h2 class="subtitle">The timer is inaccurate</h2>
        <p class="block">
            The timer in this app is designed to synchronize with the clock's second hand, resulting in a slightly shorter measurement than the specified duration, prioritizing synchronization over precise timing.
