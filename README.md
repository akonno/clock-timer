## Why another clock and timer app?

I recognized the necessity for an application that simultaneously displays a clock and a timer, which is particularly useful during tasks involving lengthy durations where monitoring the current time is essential.

Additionally, I find it unsettling when the second hand of the clock and the seconds of the timer are not synchronized, so I prefer that they move in harmony.

To prevent accidental stops or resets, you may want to disable the timer buttons while the timer is running.

Faced with the absence of such a solution, I was motivated to create this app myself.

## The timer is inaccurate

The timer in this app is designed to synchronize with the clock's second hand, resulting in a slightly shorter measurement than the specified duration, prioritizing synchronization over precise timing.
